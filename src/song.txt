"Gabriela" by KATSEYE

[Verse 1]
Hot like a bullet
Flying too fast, I couldn't catch it
Heart in the casket
You always knew it
The starring role, the main attraction
Got cameras flashing

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, ooh
You got everybody's eyes undressing you
And I see it too
Yeah, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Hands off, Gabriela, Gabriela
Hands off, Gabriela-la-la
Back off of my fella, Gabriela
Back off, Gabriela-la-la
'Cause, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you (Hey)
Hands off, Gabriela, Gabriela
Hands off, Gabriela-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Skin amaretto
I bet you taste just like the summer
Under the covers (Hey)
Me in the middle
Overprotective of my lover
You make me wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, ooh
If you made all of these fantasies come true
What would you do?
Yeah, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
But I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Hands off, Gabriela, Gabriela
Hands off, Gabriela-la-la
Back off of my fella, Gabriela
Back off, Gabriela-la-la
'Cause, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you (Hey)
Hands off, Gabriela, Gabriela
Hands off, Gabriela-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la (Oh, no)

[Bridge]
He came here with me, and with me he’ll go.
His eyes belong here, that won’t ever go.
He loves only me, the rest never show.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He came here with me, and with me he’ll go.
His eyes belong here, that won’t ever go.
He loves only me, the rest never show.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[Chorus]
Hands off, Gabriela, Gabriela
Hands off, Gabriela-la-la (Gabriela)
Back off of my fella, Gabriela
Back off, Gabriela-la-la (Oh, Gabriela-la-la)
'Cause, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you (I'm begging you; Hey)
Hands off, Gabriela (Gabriela, hands off), Gabriela
Hands off (Hands off), Gabriela-la-la, la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)

[Outro]
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la
(Back off, back off, back off)
